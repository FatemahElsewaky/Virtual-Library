* This program is a representation of a virtual library of books that implements a singly linked list.
* Our program targets two types of users: employees of the virtual library and customers of the virtual library.
* The library provides distinct options for employees and customers. Employees have the option of viewing our collection of books, 
* adding to it, removing from it, and searching for a specific title in our current collection.
* Customers, on the other hand, have the option of browsing our current collection for a book to purchase and 
* searching for a specific book in our collection without viewing it. 
* To create our libraryâ€™s collection of books, we created a text file that has the titles of one hundred books.
